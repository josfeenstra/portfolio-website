My name is Jos Feenstra, and I am a creative software engineer.

For as long as I can remember, I have been deeply fascinated by the interplay between creativity and automation. I try to fill my life with both. This has led me to a bachelors degree in Architecture, to pursuit a masters degree in Geomatics, and to build 3D engines, websites, games, and more. If I am not behind a computer screen, I enjoy cycling, origami, and making music at the Student Jazz Association Groover. 

<!-- I enjoy tackling problems which necessitate a wholistic approach. I have discovered that I can mean a lot in situations where both the mindset of a programmer & designer are needed within one skull. I get my strength from fascination in abstract and unorthodox ideas, mixing them, experimenting with them, and turning them into reality. This mixing of ideas has lead me to using geomatics-related algorithms in order to create [art][7], using game-engines to build [geomatics][5] applications, and using AI to help me design [posters][6].  -->

I enjoy tackling problems which necessitate a wholistic approach. I have discovered that I can mean a lot in situations where both the mindset of a programmer & designer are needed within one skull. If you have one of these problems lying around, or if you would just like to grab a cup of coffee, then I would love to meet you via one of the channels below! Looking forward hearing from you!
