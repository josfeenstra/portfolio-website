My name is Jos Feenstra, a 24 Years old Msc Student Geomatics at the TU Delft. Allow me to tell a little bit about myself.

I Started out at the TU Delft as a [Bsc Student Architecture & The build Environment][1]. I am a creative individual, and that, together with the spatial puzzles present in Architecture, made me fall in love with the field. And while Architecture's lessons are still invaluable to me, I increasingly became aware of a certain imbalance. I felt a need for a more a more solid foundation to build upon, something orderly to counterbalance the chaotic nature which is inevitably part of any creative endeavour.

Ironically, the virtual became this solid ground. During an excellent [Minor Programming at the University of Amsterdam][2], I reconnected with something I used to do, many years ago: coding. I knew instantly that, wherever life would take me, it needed to be within this field.

This realization gave me lots of motivation and dedication, which in turn opened up amazing opportunities.
I landed my first serious job as software developer at [Sfered][3], were I've been working ever since for 3 years now.
After finishing my bachelors degree in Architecture, I switched over to the field of [Geomatics]


3d geometry and the (un)built environment inevitably let me to a slightly different Masters degree than my peers.
I chose the Master of Geomatics, and stepped into the world of Geodesy.

Now, equiped with both the mindset of a developer and designer, I enjoy walking (...)

tackling problems which necessitate a wholistic approach. both backend and frontend
