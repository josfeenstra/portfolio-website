My name is Jos Feenstra, second year Msc Geomatics Student at the TU Delft.

For as long as I can remember, I have been deeply fascinated by three things: creativity, geometry, and automation. Naturally, I try to fill my life with all three of those things. This has led me to hold a bachelors degree in Architecture, to pursuit a masters degree in Geomatics, and to build 3D engines, websites, games, and a whole range of other things. If I am not behind a computer screen, I enjoy cycling, origami, and making music at the Student Jazz Association Groover. 

I enjoy tackling problems which necessitate a wholistic approach. I have discovered that I can mean a lot in situations where both the mindset of a programmer & designer are needed within one skull. If you have one of these problems lying around, or if you would just like to grab a cup of coffee, please do not hesitate to get in contact with me via one of the channels below. Looking forward hearing from you!
