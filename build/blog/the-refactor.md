# The art of Refactoring & Conway's Law
There is something special about the process of Refactoring. The act of making a huge part of the code obsolete with just a few lines of code is met with triumph, even if it took the programmer days or even months to create this part.

And yet refactoring is not exclusive to the domain of software engineering. All sorts of things are constantly being refactored. Whole companies, or even counties are being refactored and made obsolete as we speak, often met with terrible consequences.
