# Thesis

The Msc thesis will start for me in September 2021, But I am already working on some preliminary results. 

One of the prerequisites I will eventually need is a visual programming language (VPL) which runs in a web browser. However, not many exist that one would deem passable in 2021. 
On the other hand, creating your own VPL is a project that I've been wanting to do for a very long time. So, two birds with one stone :). 

The demo below is this VPL. As you can see, its in an early stage, it can only handle booleans at this point. Although, I suspect this could already be a useful tool for teaching the logic gates interactively. Please go try it out, and let me know what you think of it!
