# Synthesis : Project Firefighters
<br>

### Geomatics | Indoor navigation | Unity
<br>

The final course on the curriculum of Geomatics, besides the thesis, is meant as a final test, and as a 'theory meets practice' opportunity. Me and my group built a pilot project for the Rotterdam Rijnmond Safety region, with the purpose of giving high-stakes response teams a shared understanding of a complex, indoor, 3D environment. Since up to date information is paramount for such response teams, the 3D data of the environment needs to get captured, processed and visualized in near-real-time speed. At the same time, data captured by multiple field operators should be properly synchronized. These needs drove us to use unconventional methods within the field of Geomatics, like the Microsoft Hololens, and the Unity 3D game engine. 

We got to present our results during the NCG2020 Conference, and the presentation of which can be found [here][1]. Our original video can also be found on [Youtube][2], voiced by my great teammate Robin.
