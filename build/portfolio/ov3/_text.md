### Student assistant | Grasshopper tutoring | Computational design

<!-- body -->
[BK3OV3][1] Is a subject given at the TU-Delft, Faculty of Architecture, during the bachelor.
It teaches architecture students a methodology dubbed *computational design* (also called *parametric design* or *performative design*).
Computational design can be explained as utilizing the computational abilities of
3D software packages not only for documentation at the end of a design process,
but also fully **within** explorative endeavours.

Within a design process, many parameters,
such as the height of a building or the number of windows, are not set in stone, and often completely unknown.
It is the job of the designer to figure out which parameters are 'best'.
What is regarded as 'best' can be determined both by quantifiable means,
such as solar potential, constructive robustness or the fastest fire escape plans,
and by qualitative means, such as navigability, aesthetic quality, and symbolic
representation (is this school properly playful? is this office professional enough? etc.).

By building 3D models that can properly accommodate fluidity and 'unknowingness',
the designer can start a whole new dialogue with his or her digital aid.
A vast range of different configurations can be calculated and explored to find the best possible combination of parameters,
and software such as [Grasshopper 3D][2] can be used to judge quantifiable properties of these iterations.

This course is very dear to me, since it introduced me to computational geometry and programming as a whole.
I wanted to give back some of the things I have learned during my time at [UvA][4]
and [Sfered][3], and that's how I returned back to BK3OV3 after 3 years, as a student assistant. I assisted in the shape
of a helpdesk, where I gave students advice and demonstrations of how their regular design problems could be converted into
parametric, digital configurations. This created several small sample projects, which I have documented in [this][5] repo.
It was a great experience to work together with the some of the faculty's experts on computational design.
They were very welcoming, I learned a great deal from them, and we had a lot of fun!
