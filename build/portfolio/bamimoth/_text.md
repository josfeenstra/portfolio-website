Bamimoth is an Indie Gamedev studio me and my friends set up as a side project. What makes these games unique and fun is that they are truly set up as interactive simulations. Adding a system like AI, space gravity, or fluid dynamics makes a digital world feel alive: It will move and do its own thing, regardless of if the player is there to witness it. 

The two main programmers, Frank & Ward, keep fascinating me with their genius & insane coding speed. I like to contribute to our projects in any way I can, be it artwork, gameplay, or code.
