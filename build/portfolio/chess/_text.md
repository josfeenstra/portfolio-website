### Game | Chess

Chessnuts is a small project I'm working on in my space time. Right now, the
AI uses a simple brute force algorithm to calculate all possible moves. It has
won a couple of times from me. Now, I'm by no means a good chess player, but
still: Being defeated by your own algorithm is both a humiliating and
satisfying experience!
