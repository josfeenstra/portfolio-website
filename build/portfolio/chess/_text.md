### Game | Chess

[Chessnuts][1] is a small project I'm working on in my space time. Right now, the
AI uses a simple brute force algorithm to calculate all possible moves. It has
won a couple of times from me. Now, I'm by no means a good chess player, but
still. Being defeated by your own algorithm is both a humiliating and
a weirdly satisfying feeling.

Art and scripting by me.
