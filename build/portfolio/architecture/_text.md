# Bachelor of Architecture

### Bachelor Architecture & The Build Environment | TU Delft University of Technology

While I have completely deviated from the path of architect, I cannot understate
how much this education has shaped my thinking about any type of creative
production, including coding. As an architecture student, I have not only
learned how to design buildings, but also delved into similar fields, such as
real estate management, landscape architecture, and city planning. 

By far the most impressive courses where the ON-courses, the design studio's. These are well-known 
for their tough deadlines, wide range of requirements (from constructive analysis to furniture placement sketches),
and their creative complexity (design what a city would look like in 50 years). 
It was here that your creative process and workflows really got tested on a personal level. 
They say that the best lessons are often the most painful ones, so lets say that I learned a lot :).

My opinion on the field of architecture as I experienced it is still quite divided. 
The study of architecture can sometimes be very disfocussed, and together with 
the difficulty of benchmarking progress in something as creative as 'design', it often left 
me feeling quite lost, like I was doing or producing nothing of concrete value.

On the other hand, the 'idea' of being an architect still seems lovely to me. 
I thourougly enjoyed the role of visionary, coming up with spatial configurations, 
testing, discussing, presenting and defending very abstract ideas, etc. This is 
why I can't help but think fondly of my three years as an architecture student, and 
the bachelors degree it left me with.
