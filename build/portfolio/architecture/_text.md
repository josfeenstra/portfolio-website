# Bachelor of Architecture

<!-- subtitle -->
### Bouwkunde | Architecture student | TU Delft University of Technology

<!-- body -->
While I have completely deviated from the path of architect, I cannot understate
how much this education has shaped my thinking about any type of creative
production, including coding. As an architecture student, I have not only
learned how to design buildings, but also delved into similar fields, such as
real estate management, landscape architecture, and city planning.
By far the most impressive courses where the ON-courses, the design studio's.
