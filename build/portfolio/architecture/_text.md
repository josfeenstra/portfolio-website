# Bachelor of Architecture

### Bachelor Architecture & The Build Environment | TU Delft University of Technology
<br>

I hold a Bachelors degree in Architecture & The Build Environment which I followed at the TU Delft.

While I have completely deviated from the path of architect, I cannot understate how much this education has shaped my thinking about any type of creative production, including coding. I thoroughly enjoy the role of visionary, coming up with (spatial) configurations, and testing, discussing, presenting & defending abstract ideas. This is why I can't help but think fondly of my three years as an architecture student, even though it is not directly applicable anymore to my daily life.

<!-- As an architecture student, I have not only learned how someone can design buildings, but also how someone could design anything.  -->
<!-- By far the most impressive courses where the ON-courses, the design studios. These are well-known for their tough deadlines, wide range of requirements (from constructive analysis to furniture placement sketches), and their creative complexity (design what a city would look like in 50 years). It was here that your creative process and workflows really got tested on a personal level. They say that the best lessons are often the most painful ones, so let’s say that I learned a lot :). -->
<!-- 
My opinion on the field of architecture as I experienced it is still quite divided. The study of architecture can sometimes be very unfocused, and together with the difficulty of benchmarking progress in something as creative as 'design', it often left me feeling quite lost, like I was doing or producing nothing of concrete value.

On the other hand, the 'idea' of being an architect still seems great to me.  -->
