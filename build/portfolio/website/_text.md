### Web Development | Typescript

This website is created not only as a way to showcase my work,
but also as an opportunity to learn how to build websites. Before I started building it,
I knew nothing about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or any other skill necessary to accomplish such a task.
While I'm still far from an expert on these subjects, I am however, proud to have built this environment.

This website is set up as a Single Page Application, written using raw HTML, CSS, and Typescript. It uses Bootstrap to make the website more mobile friendly, and Showdown to parse markdown
