### Web Development | Typescript

<!-- body -->
This website is created not only as a way to showcase my work,
but also as an opportunity to learn how to build websites. Before I started building it,
I knew nothing about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or any other skill necessary to accomplish such a task.
While I'm still far from an expert on these subjects, I am however, proud to have built this environment.
<br><br>

This website is set up by using solely HTML, CSS, and Typescript. does not use
any framework or external libraries, aside from [showdown][1], an excellent, lightweight markdown parser.
The website, along with this framework, can be found [here][2].
