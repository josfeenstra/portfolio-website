# Geomatics
<br>

### Master | Geodesy | TU Delft
<br>

Geomatics is the Master degree I am pursuing at the moment. 

While this education is located within the faculty of architecture at the TU-Delft, 
That is about all the connection it has to my bachelor of architecture. 
The field of Geomatics / GIS / Geodesy was completely new to me when I started out as a first year student, 
and while I had previously touched QGIS, I by no means claimed to be any good at it. 

So why choose geomatics? Well, because I suspected that, below this surface level of completely new concept such as lidar scanners, aerial photography, and land surveying, it was actually pretty similar to exactly what I wanted to be studying: Computational geometry applied to built and unbuild environment. 
This suspicion appeared to be correct, as in the second quarter, we started to finally learn the deeper theory of concepts I had touched during my time toying with geometry. Linear algebra applied to 3D graphics, common data structures of 3D geometry such as breps, Least squares adjustment of point-clouds, etc. 

Right now, I am still having a great time studying here, and I will be starting my thesis soon.
