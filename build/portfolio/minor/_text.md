# Minor Programming

### Bachelor Minor | University of Amsterdam

The TU-Delft, like many other universities, grants its students a moment during the curriculum of its bachelors, 
in which students can diverge, called the Minor. One semester long, a student can basicly choose to study whatever they so desire. 
This could have a strong connection to their main bachelor, but it could also be something completely different. 
I chose for the 'Minor Programming', given at the University of Amsterdam. It attracted students from many different fields, so I shared my classes with students studying math, biology, and even some studying political science and sociology. 

The curriculum of this minor was very well put together. Or first couple of "hello world"-type courses where a combination of CS50 courses at Harvard, and in-person assistance. They started out with C, and worked their way up to higher level languages such as python. It then dove into more academic subjects like problem optimization, in which you have to use hill-climbers, basic forms of machine learning, and other optimization algorithms to tackle some concrete problem. This is where we built [this][1] algorithm to efficiently place down villa's in a very abstracted version of city planning.

I can now see in hindsight that this Minor has had a profound impact on me. I can't thank them enough for the lessons they taught me, the friends I made, and the opportunities this Minor opened op to me. I have also noticed that not many minors grant this level of quality and cohesion, so I highly recommend [this minor][2] to anyone who does not know which minor to choose (this is not sponsored btw :).
