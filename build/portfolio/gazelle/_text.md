# Gazelle

### Grasshopper Plugin | Parametric product design

Gazelle is a custom plugin in C# for the parametric modelling tool Grasshopper, which houses several workflow optimizations, runtime improvements, and  features, specifically meant for parametric product design. These new features include production code insertion, brep topology fixes, and a system to easily setup model parameters. Gazelle is used several [Sfered][1] scripts. 

I Developed the entire plugin from scratch during my time at Sfered as a solution to several unsolved worflow issues we were experiencing using grasshopper for our purposes. I am particularly proud of the brep tools, which improve the running time of certain intersection procedures exponentially. The tools to confortably use JSON's within grasshopper without having to explicitly write down keys was also a great addition to our workflow.  

I would love to point to the repo, but this was a closed source project, as parts of it are now patented. Still, please contact me if you would like to know more, I am sure something can be arranged.
