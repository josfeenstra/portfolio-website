# Geon Engine
<br>

### Computational Geometry | 3D Rendering | Web Frontend
<br>


Geon is a 3D engine which can create and visualize three dimensional scenes in a web browser. 
It is a culmination of algorithms learned during the Master of Geomatics, and a ton of hobby coding projects. It contains tools for creating and showing all sorts of geometries, and everything needed to support that. The background of this website is for example created using Geon.

Besides the tools to build it (webpack, typescript), it contains no dependencies, which makes it very fast to load, run and maintain. 

Geon was my pride an joy during the pandemic, my beacon of hope :). It gave the pandemic a positive side, since I don't think I would have found the time to write the over 15.000 lines of code needed to create it otherwise.
